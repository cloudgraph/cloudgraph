/**
 * Generates a row key based on the configured CloudGraph row key {@link org.cloudgraph.config.RowKeyModel
 * model} for a specific table {@link org.cloudgraph.config.Table configuration}. 
 * <p>
 * The initial creation and subsequent reconstitution for query retrieval
 * purposes of both row and column keys in CloudGraph&#8482; is efficient, 
 * as it leverages byte array level API in both Java and the current 
 * underlying SDO 2.1 implementation, <a target="#" href="http://plasma-sdo.org">PlasmaSDO&#8482;</a>. Both composite row and 
 * column keys are composed in part of structural metadata, and the 
 * lightweight metadata API within <a target="#" href="http://plasma-sdo.org">PlasmaSDO&#8482;</a> contains byte-array level, 
 * cached lookup of all basic metadata elements including logical and 
 * physical type and property names.
