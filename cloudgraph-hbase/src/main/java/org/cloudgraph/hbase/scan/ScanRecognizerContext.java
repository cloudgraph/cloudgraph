/**
 * Context which supports the "recognition" of one or more 
 * {@link PartialRowKey partial}, {@link FuzzyRowKey fuzzy} and other
 * and other scan constructs within the context of a binary 
 * {@link Expr expression} syntax tree. 
 * <p>
 * Composite row key scans represent only {@link org.cloudgraph.hbase.expr.LogicalBinaryExpr logical binary} 'AND'
 * expressions across the key fields. So
 * for {@link org.cloudgraph.hbase.expr.RelationalBinaryExpr relational binary} expressions
 * linked within a query syntax tree by one or more logical binary 'AND', 
 * expressions, a single {@link PartialRowKey partial} or {@link FuzzyRowKey fuzzy}
 * row key scan may be used. But for {@link org.cloudgraph.hbase.expr.RelationalBinaryExpr relational binary} expressions
 * linked by {@link org.cloudgraph.hbase.expr.LogicalBinaryExpr logical binary} 'OR' expressions
 * multiple scans must be used. Clients of this context class may execute the
 * resulting scans in series or in parallel depending on various performance
 * and other considerations.
