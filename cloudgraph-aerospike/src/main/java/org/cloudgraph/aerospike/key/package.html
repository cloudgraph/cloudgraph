Contains HBase composite row and column key creation interfaces and infrastructure. 
<p>
The initial creation and subsequent reconstitution for query retrieval
purposes of both row and column keys in CloudGraph&#8482; 
leverages byte array level API in both Java and the current 
underlying SDO 2.1 implementation, <a target="#" href="http://plasma-sdo.org">PlasmaSDO&#8482;</a>. Both composite row and 
column keys are composed in part of structural metadata, and the 
lightweight metadata API within <a target="#" href="http://plasma-sdo.org">PlasmaSDO&#8482;</a> contains byte-array level, 
cached lookup of all basic metadata elements including logical and 
physical type and property names.
