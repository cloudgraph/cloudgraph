Analyzes the characteristics of a query and assembles composite start and stop row keys, 
in order to leverage the important HBase partial row-key scan
capability for every possible query predicate expression.
<p>
For each set of query predicates forming the basis for an HBase 
scan, a set of context rich, data "flavor" specific structures are
constructed to abstract the complexities involved in assembling the various segments and fields of
composite (scan start/stop) row keys under various relational and logical operator and
various configurable composite key-field hashing, formatting, padding 
and other features. If an HBase partial row-key scan is possible
based on the literal set, a 
{@link PartialRowKeyScanAssembler} is 
invoked using the current scan context resulting in a pair 
of composite start/stop row keys. These are then used in the HBase 
client <a target="#" href="http://hbase.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/Scan.html">scan</a> API
start and stop row.
